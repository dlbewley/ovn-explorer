# OVN Explorer Application

I've created a complete Python application for exploring Open Virtual Networks (OVN) in OpenShift environments. The application is structured as follows:

└── tests/                # Tests
    └── test_ovn_connection.py # OVN connection tests
```

## Key Features

1. **OVN Connection**: Uses the Kubernetes client library to connect to OVN northbound database pods in OpenShift clusters.
2. **GUI Interface**: Built with PyQt6, providing a clean and intuitive interface.
3. **Network Visualization**: Uses NetworkX and Matplotlib to visualize OVN components.
4. **Component Explorer**: Tree view for browsing OVN components (Logical Routers, Logical Switches, Load Balancers, Ports).
5. **Detail View**: Shows detailed information about selected components.
6. **Console**: Allows executing OVN commands and viewing the output.
7. **Configuration Management**: YAML-based configuration with sensible defaults.
8. **Testing Infrastructure**: Unit tests with mocking for testing without a real OpenShift cluster.

## How It Works

1. The application connects to an OpenShift cluster using the Kubernetes client library.
2. It finds the OVN northbound database pod using the specified namespace and label selector.
3. It executes commands in the pod to retrieve information about OVN components.
4. The information is parsed and displayed in the GUI.
5. The user can interact with the visualization, explore components, and execute commands.

## Next Steps

To continue developing this application, you might consider:

1. **Enhancing the Visualization**: Add more sophisticated network topology visualization.
2. **Adding More OVN Components**: Support for additional OVN components like ACLs, NAT, etc.
3. **Implementing Real-time Updates**: Periodically refresh the data to show changes in real-time.
4. **Adding Configuration Editor**: GUI for editing the configuration file.
5. **Supporting Multiple Clusters**: Allow connecting to multiple OpenShift clusters.
6. **Adding Authentication Options**: Support for different authentication methods.
7. **Implementing Filtering and Search**: Allow filtering and searching for components.
8. **Adding Export/Import**: Export and import network topology data.

## Running the Application

To run the application, you need to:

1. Install the dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Ensure you're logged into your OpenShift cluster: `oc login --token=<token> --server=<server>`
3. Run the application: `./ovn_explorer.py` or `python ovn_explorer.py`

This MVP provides a solid foundation for exploring OVN networks in OpenShift environments and can be extended with additional features as needed.
